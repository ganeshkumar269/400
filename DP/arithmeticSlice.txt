Q:  Given an array of integers, find the no. of subarrays length >= 3 which have an arithmetic progression
 
    Eg. [1,2,3,4] -> [1,2,3],[1,2,3,4],[2,3,4] i,e 3

A:
    Approach: Iterate through the array 
        if diff is the same for 2 consecutive times increment res variable by current_index - start_index - 1
    whenever there is achange in diff b/w consecutive elements start the process again.

TimeComplexity: O(n)
