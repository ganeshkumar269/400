Q: Given a number n , following operations are done
    1. if power of 2 , it is divided by 2
    2. else subtracted from the highest power 2 less than n

    Louise and Richard takes turns , Louise starts first.
    Who would win for a given n

Ans:
    Brute Force:
        int res = 0;
        while(n != 1) :
            if( ceil(log2(n)) == floor(log2(n)))
                n = n >>1 
            else n-= log2(n)
            res++
        if res is odd   Louise
        else Richard
    Time Complexity O(log2(n)*log2(n))

    Optimised:
       while(n%2 == 0 ) res++ , n= n >> 1;
       while( n!= 1) res++ if n&1 , n = n >> 1

       Time Complexity O(log2(n))
