normal notation :  1 2 3 4 5   -> original set
                   5 3 2 4 1    ->permuatation of the set
                
    This is easier to construct aswell as to read, but takes a lot of space

Cycle Notation: 
    From above example (1->5,  5->1) (2->, 3->2) (4->4)
    Can be compressed to (1 5)(2 3)(4)
    Each set here is a cycle and the set with length n is called as n-cycle. Two cycle is also called as transposition.
    One cycles can be ignored.The example can be rewritten as,
        (1 5)(2 3) 
    A lot of space is saved.
